# Rainfall Prediction Project

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook focused on predicting rainfall using machine learning techniques. The project uses data preprocessing, visualization, and predictive modeling to analyze and forecast rainfall patterns.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: Build a model to predict rainfall based on meteorological data.
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing
  - Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
  - Model training and evaluation
  - Insights from predictive analysis

## How to Use

1. Open the `Rainfall-pred.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
2. Execute the cells step by step to understand the workflow.
3. Analyze the results and predictions provided in the notebook.

## Results

The project demonstrates the rainfall prediction process and evaluates the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Requirements

The notebook requires Python and libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, and Seaborn.
